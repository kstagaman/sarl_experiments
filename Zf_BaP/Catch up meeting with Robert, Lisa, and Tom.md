# Catch up meeting with Robert, Lisa, and Tom

## So far
1. Sterility issue has been fixed. Fish are reliably sterile to 5 dpf
2. Dechorionation is still variable and we're using 2x pronase. Might be fixed with making new pronase?
3. Sorting embryos under the hood is still pretty difficult. Definitely a difference between GF and CVZ embryos in terms of mortality.

## Next steps
1. BaP exposures in CV fish
    - growing them out to 10 dpf?
    - can we just have these go through the normal pipeline?
    - we need dissecting scopes for a day
2. Making GF work better
    - Can we get a bigger magnifying glass or another solution?

-------------------------

## DISCUSSION
Dechorionating is not essential, so let's not do it

CV + BaP gradient pilot experiment: 1 plate, dissect all guts at 10 dpf and also extract DNA from water in each well
    - four BaP gradient steps
    - 16S sequencing
        - how do we determine that sequencing the water is enough?
            + ordination and PERMANOVA?
            + individual taxon abundance correlations?
